## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack ‚Äì Built for Speed & Scale

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.3.3 (App Router) + React + Tailwind CSS + ShadCN UI
- **Backend/AI**: Firebase Studio + Genkit (AI Flows for parsing & scoring) ‚Äì *Hosted as a separate project (see below)*
- **Database/Storage**: Firebase Firestore & Storage
- **Styling**: Inter Font, Deep Indigo (#3F51B5) Primary, Soft Teal (#4DB6AC) Accents
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend) + Firebase Hosting (Backend)
- **Other Goodies**: TypeScript, Custom Hooks, Responsive Design (Mobile-First)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend Deployment Note
The backend (powered by Genkit and Firebase for AI-driven resume and JD parsing) is maintained as a **separate project** due to Vercel‚Äôs limitations with complex server-side logic and large dependencies (e.g., `node_modules/@next/swc-*` files exceeding GitHub‚Äôs 100 MB limit). This ensures a lightweight, fast frontend deployment on Vercel while the backend runs on Firebase Hosting. To set up the backend, check the [HireLightATS-Backend](https://github.com/TanushreeSarkar/HireLightATS-Backend) repository for instructions. The frontend communicates seamlessly with the backend via API endpoints configured in `.env`.

**Why Separate?** Early attempts to push the full project to GitHub failed due to large files (e.g., `next-swc` binaries over 140 MB). Manual uploads caused branch divergence, and Vercel‚Äôs build process couldn‚Äôt find the `src/app` directory until the root was set to `src` via `vercel.json`. Splitting the project resolved these issues, enabling smooth deployment and scalability.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design

Hire-Light-ATScore is designed as a modular, scalable system with a clear separation of frontend and backend responsibilities. Below is a detailed breakdown of the architecture, including components, data flow, and interactions.

### System Components
1. **Frontend (Next.js)**:
   - Hosted on Vercel, located in `src/app` with App Router.
   - Handles UI rendering, user interactions, and API calls.
   - Key pages: Dashboard, Upload, Profile, Reports, Auth (Login/Signup), History, HireHelper, Premium Features.
   - Uses Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, and Recharts for visualizations.

2. **Backend (Firebase + Genkit)**:
   - Hosted separately on Firebase Hosting ([HireLightATS-Backend](https://github.com/TanushreeSarkar/HireLightATS-Backend)).
   - Manages AI-driven resume/JD parsing, scoring, and report generation.
   - Uses Genkit Flows (`src/ai/flows`) for AI logic and Firebase Functions for serverless endpoints.

3. **Database/Storage (Firebase)**:
   - **Firestore**: Stores user profiles, preferences, parsed data (skills, scores), and activity history.
   - **Storage**: Handles resume/JD uploads (PDF/Text) and PDF reports.

4. **External APIs**:
   - Genkit AI for natural language processing and reasoning.
   - Firebase Authentication for user management.

### Architecture Diagram
Below is an ASCII representation of the system architecture. For a polished visual, use tools like Lucidchart or Draw.io and save to `docs/architecture.png`.

```
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
|     Frontend      |       |      Backend      |       |     Firebase      |
| (Next.js/Vercel)  |<----->| (Genkit/Firebase) |<----->| (Firestore/Storage)|
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
| - Dashboard       |       | - API Endpoints   |       | - User Profiles   |
| - Upload Page     |       | - Resume Parsing  |       | - Parsed Data     |
| - Profile Page    |       | - JD Parsing      |       | - File Storage    |
| - Reports Page    |       | - Fit Scoring     |       | - Auth Data       |
| - Auth Pages      |       | - Report Gen      |       | - History Logs    |
| - History Page    |       | - Helper Prompts  |       +-------------------+
| - HireHelper      |       +-------------------+
| - Premium Features|       | Genkit AI (NLP)   |
| - Visualizations  |       +-------------------+
+-------------------+
```

**Flow Explanation**:
- **User Interaction**: Users access the frontend via browser, interacting with pages (e.g., Upload, Dashboard, Reports).
- **File Upload**: Resumes/JDs are uploaded to Firebase Storage, triggering backend API calls.
- **AI Processing**: Backend (Genkit) parses files, extracts data, and scores fits, storing results in Firestore.
- **Data Retrieval**: Frontend fetches parsed data/scores via API for display (e.g., charts, reports, history).
- **Report Generation**: Backend generates PDFs using jsPDF, stored in Firebase Storage for download.
- **Helper & Premium**: HireHelper provides AI-driven prompts; Premium Features include advanced scoring options.

### Flowcharts
Below are flowcharts for key processes, with Mermaid syntax for GitHub rendering. Save visual diagrams in `docs/flowcharts/` using tools like Mermaid or PlantUML.

#### 1. Resume Upload & Scoring Flow
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Uploads Resume] --> B[Frontend: Send to Firebase Storage]
    B --> C[Storage: File Saved]
    C --> D[Backend: Trigger Genkit Flow]
    D --> E[Parse Resume (Skills, Exp)]
    E --> F[Store Parsed Data in Firestore]
    F --> G[Calculate Score]
    G --> H[Return Score to Frontend]
    H --> I[Display Score on Dashboard]
```

**Explanation**:
- User uploads a resume (PDF/Text) via the Upload page.
- Frontend sends the file to Firebase Storage using React Dropzone.
- Backend (Genkit Flow in `src/ai/flows/analyze-resume.ts`) parses the resume, extracting skills, experience, and achievements.
- Parsed data is stored in Firestore; a score is calculated based on user preferences.
- Frontend retrieves and displays the score with visualizations (Recharts progress bars).

#### 2. Resume-JD Fit Scoring Flow
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Upload Resume + JD] --> B[Frontend: Send to Firebase Storage]
    B --> C[Storage: Files Saved]
    C --> D[Backend: Parse Resume + JD]
    D --> E[Extract Skills/Reqs]
    E --> F[Store in Firestore]
    F --> G[Compare Resume vs. JD]
    G --> H[Generate Fit Score + Explanation]
    H --> I[Return to Frontend]
    I --> J[Display on Dashboard (Donut Chart)]
```

**Explanation**:
- User uploads both resume and JD.
- Backend parses both using Genkit, extracting relevant fields (skills, roles, requirements).
- A reasoning engine compares extracted data to generate a Fit Score with explanations.
- Results are stored in Firestore and displayed on the frontend with visualizations.

#### 3. Report Generation Flow
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Requests Report] --> B[Frontend: Call Backend API]
    B --> C[Backend: Fetch Data from Firestore]
    C --> D[Generate PDF with jsPDF]
    D --> E[Store PDF in Firebase Storage]
    E --> F[Return Download Link to Frontend]
    F --> G[User Downloads PDF]
```

**Explanation**:
- User clicks "Download Report" on the Reports page.
- Frontend calls backend API to fetch scores and parsed data from Firestore.
- Backend generates a PDF using jsPDF, including scores, matches, and highlights.
- PDF is stored in Firebase Storage; a download link is sent to the frontend.

### Why This Architecture?
- **Scalability**: Frontend (Vercel) and backend (Firebase) separation ensures fast, independent scaling.
- **Modularity**: Genkit Flows (`src/ai/flows`) isolate AI logic for easy updates.
- **Reliability**: Firebase Storage/Firestore handle large files and data reliably, bypassing Vercel‚Äôs limits.
- **User Experience**: Next.js App Router and Tailwind CSS deliver a responsive, animated UI.
